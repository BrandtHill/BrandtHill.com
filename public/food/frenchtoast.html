    <h1>Recipe | Custard French Toast</h1>
    <p>French toast is known by many names, and it's been around for well over a millennia. It's an ingenious way to utilize stale bread. In the modern day with such excess of food and preservatives, finding a use for stale bread usually isn't necessary, but French toast is good enough to make on demand with fresh ingredients. This recipe involves dipping bread in a crème anglaise, so perhaps it ought to be called English toast. Food for thought.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
      <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 egg yolks</li>
      <li>Sliced bread of choice</li>
      <li>Butter to coat pan</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Conveniently, all of the ingredients for the custard are in amounts of 1/4, even the egg yolks, which you can think of as 1/4 of an octet of eggs (haha).</p>
    <h4>Custard</h4>
    <p>This custard is a crème anglaise with a high egg ratio to make for a protein-rich French toast. You can realistically use the whole egg, but I called for only the yolks to create a more standard custard.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Put milk, cream, vanilla, and cinnamon pot on medium heat</li>
      <li>Crack eggs and put yolks into a dish (use egg whites for another recipe)</li>
      <li>Add sugar to egg yolks, and whisk together</li>
      <li>Once cream mixture is hot, slowly pour some of the cream into the egg yolks while stirring</li>
      <li>Now that egg yolks have been delicately tempered (and not curdled), incorporate yolks into pot with cream</li>
      <li>Continuously stir custard mix on medium heat, avoiding boiling and curdling eggs, until slightly thickened</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Frying Bread</h4>
    <p>When you're ready to dip the bread into the custard, stir the custard to reincorporate the cinnamon since it settles at the bottom.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt some butter in pan on low-medium heat, and watch to avoid burning</li>
      <li>Pour custard into bowl</li>
      <li>Briefly soak both sides of bread slice in custard</li>
      <li>Place coated bread into pan, flipping periodically until both sides golden</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Garnishing</h4>
    <p>Once your French toast has been sufficiently fried, top it with confectioner's sugar. If your custard turned out well enough, you use it as a sauce. Alternatively you can top your toast with maple syrup. Make sure you use real maple syrup; fake maple syrup is quite disgusting and should be avoided at all costs.</p>
