    <p>Nothing is quite as upsetting as ordering a grilled cheese from a restaurant only to be greeted by a sandwich with tomatoes, bacon, pickles even, and Lord knows what else. I assert that a grilled cheese should contains nothing more than bread, butter, and cheese. This recipe is <i>just</i> that. Panini press required.</p>
    <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 slices artisan white bread (e.g. sourdough, Tuscan, etc.)</li>
      <li>2 thin slices mild/medium cheddar</li>
      <li>1 thin slice provolone</li>
      <li>Salted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can opt to use a whole wheat or whole grain bread, but I find that the taste somewhat overpowers the rest of the sandwich. You might choose sharp cheddar in mild or medium cheddar&#39;s stead, but sharp cheddar is a little too pungent for me to eat in such a quantity on a sandwich.</p>
    <h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat panini press</li>
      <li>Tear cheeses slices into halves or quarters to fit bread geometry</li>
      <li>Place torn cheese slices distributed as evenly as possible onto slice of bread to minimize hanging cheese</li>
      <li>Spread butter onto both external sides of completed sandwich, the more the merrier</li>
      <li>Place sandwich onto hot panini press, and lower top half of press to begin grilling both sides</li>
      <li>Inspect sandwich periodically, and when both sides darkened grill marks, carefully extract sandwich as to avoid creating a hand-panini</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Look at that! A grilled cheese with no nonsense. You can pick up a cheap panini press for around $30. Of course, you can experiment with different types of cheese and bread. Standard shelf-stable sandwich bread and/or Kraft singles will yield disappointing results, though.</p>
