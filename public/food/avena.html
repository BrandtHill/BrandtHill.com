    <h1>Recipe | Avena Mexicana</h1>
    <p>This recipe is courtesy of my mother in law. Mexican oatmeal is similar to American oatmeal, but it's cooked with cinnamon and has much more milk. The key to this recipe is using Mexican cinnamon, also known as Ceylon cinnamon or "true" cinnamon. While grown in Sri Lanka, Ceylon cinnamon is used heavily in Mexican cooking. It looks and tastes different than Cassia cinnamon we're used to in America. Cassia is good but quite pungent tasting, whereas Ceylon is a milder, perhaps more pleasent tasting spice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup oats</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>2-3 cups milk</li>
      <li>1 stick Mexican cinnamon</li>
      <li>2-4 Tbsp light brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I use rolled oats. You can use steel-cut oats, but note that this requires a higher water-to-oat ratio. For Ceylon cinnamon, go to your local Mexican store and look for canela en rama, or look on Amazon for Ceylon cinnamon sticks. You can use non-dairy milks if desired. I suppose one could even use oat milk, but that seems a little on the nose.</p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Put water in pot and bring to boil</li>
      <li>Break cinnamon stick in half and place into pot to diffuse</li>
      <li>Once boiling, cook oats until about ready, stirring occasionally</li>
      <li>Add milk, sugar, and vanilla, and stir into oats</li>
      <li>Heat for a few more minutes until contents at a comfortable eating temperature</li>
    </ol>
