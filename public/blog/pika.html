    <h1>Making a RabbitMQ Producer and Consumer with Pika</h1>
    <p>RabbitMQ is a popular open source AMQP message broker. Technically RabbitMQ implements several messaging protocols with the addition of plugins and adapters, but AMQP is RabbitMQ’s primary purpose and the focus of this blog post. Most popular programming languages have an AMQP library, and the RabbitMQ team claims <a href="https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html" style="color: rgb(21, 247, 0)">Pika</a> to be the de facto standard library for Python, and that’s what we’ll be using today. Many applications will be either producing or consuming, but when an application does both, it’s recommended to separate the roles of producer and consumer. I’m going to demonstrate how you can easily perform both roles within an application using a <em>single</em> connection.</p>
    <h2>Creating a Connection Class</h2>
    <p>We’ll be making a simple app that sends messages to itself and prints them upon receipt. <a href="https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html" style="color: rgb(21, 247, 0)">Pika</a> isn’t thread safe and doesn’t implement auto-reconnecting, but there are ways to make it behave as such. First we’ll need to <code class="prettyprint">pip install</code> the packages <code class="prettyprint">pika</code> and <code class="prettyprint">retry</code>. Next we’ll need a class that represents an AMQP connection in a file named <code class="prettyprint">amqpconnection.py</code>. This class will be a wrapper around pika’s <code class="prettyprint">connection</code> and <code class="prettyprint">channel</code> classes, and the result should be easy to adapt for a more complex application. The class outline will look something like this.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
import pika
import functools
import os
from retry import retry

class AmqpConnection:
    def __init__():
    def connect():
    def setup_queues():
    def do_async():
    def publish():
    def consume():
    </pre>
    <p>The constructor will take RabbitMQ connection information and credentials with sane defaults, and it will set our <code class="prettyprint">connection</code> and <code class="prettyprint">channel</code> fields to <code class="prettyprint">None</code>.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
def __init__(self, hostname='localhost', port=5672, username='guest', password='guest'):
    self.hostname = hostname
    self.port = port
    self.username = username
    self.password = password
    self.connection = None
    self.channel = None      
    </pre>
    <p>The <code class="prettyprint">connect</code> method will wrap pika’s constructs and connect to the RabbitMQ server. It will accept a custom connection string as a parameter for human readability.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
def connect(self, connection_name='Neat-App'):
    print('Attempting to connect to', self.hostname)
    params = pika.ConnectionParameters(
        host=self.hostname,
        port=self.port,
        credentials=pika.PlainCredentials(self.username, self.password),
        client_properties={'connection_name': connection_name})
    self.connection = pika.BlockingConnection(parameters=params)
    self.channel = self.connection.channel()
    print('Connected Successfully to', self.hostname)
    </pre>
    <p>The <code class="prettyprint">setup_queues</code> method will declare exchanges and queues and bind queues to exchanges if needed. If you wanted to just use a queue without messing with exchanges, you could simply declare a queue; to publish to the queue, use an empty string as the exchange (interpreted as the default exchange) and use the queue name as the routing key.<br>
      For our app, we’ll declare a direct exchange called <code class="prettyprint">Ping_Exchange</code>, a queue called <code class="prettyprint">Ping_Queue</code>, and bind the queue to the exchange with routing key <code class="prettyprint">ping</code>.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
def setup_queues(self):
    self.channel.exchange_declare('Ping_Exchange', exchange_type='direct')
    self.channel.queue_declare('Ping_Queue')
    self.channel.queue_bind('Ping_Queue', exchange='Ping_Exchange', routing_key='ping')
    </pre>
    <p>The <code class="prettyprint">do_async</code> method will wrap the connection’s <code class="prettyprint">add_callback_threadsafe</code> method. This is necessary for multi-threaded apps since pika isn’t thread safe; we must use <code class="prettyprint">add_callback_threadsafe</code> anytime we want to perform a network action on a different thread than the main connection thread. Since <code class="prettyprint">add_callback_threadsafe</code> only accepts a single callable argument, we’ll have to use <code class="prettyprint">functools.partial</code> to pass arguments to the callback.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
def do_async(self, callback, *args, **kwargs):
    if self.connection.is_open:
        self.connection.add_callback_threadsafe(functools.partial(callback, *args, **kwargs))
    </pre>
    <p>The <code class="prettyprint">publish</code> method will wrap the channel’s <code class="prettyprint">basic_publish</code> method. In our application, we’ll publish a given payload to the exchange we declared in the <code class="prettyprint">setup_queues</code> method.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
def publish(self, payload):
    if self.connection.is_open and self.channel.is_open:
        self.channel.basic_publish(
            exchange='Ping_Exchange',
            routing_key='ping',
            body=payload
        )
    </pre>
    <p>The <code class="prettyprint">consume</code> method will consume messages from the previously declared queue with the given <code class="prettyprint">on_message</code> callback function. This method will be run in the main thread, and it will block on the <code class="prettyprint">start_consuming</code> method. Adding the <code class="prettyprint">retry</code> annotation allows our application to automatically reconnect. In the event of a reconnection attempt, there will be a delay of one second that doubles after each attempt.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
@retry(pika.exceptions.AMQPConnectionError, delay=1, backoff=2)
def consume(self, on_message):
    if self.connection.is_closed or self.channel.is_closed:
        self.connect()
        self.setup_queues()
    try:
        self.channel.basic_consume(queue='Ping_Queue', auto_ack=True, on_message_callback=on_message)
        self.channel.start_consuming()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print('Keyboard interrupt received')
        self.channel.stop_consuming()
        self.connection.close()
        os._exit(1)
    except pika.exceptions.ChannelClosedByBroker:
        print('Channel Closed By Broker Exception')
    </pre>
    <h2>Using the Connection Class</h2>
    <p>With our <code class="prettyprint">AmqpConnection</code> class we can now interface with a RabbitMQ server and start on our simple application. It’ll send a randomly selected message every few seconds, and, when it is consumed, print it out and track how many times the message has been received. Let’s start by creating a file called <code class="prettyprint">app.py</code> and import our class. The outline of this file will look like the following.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
from amqpconnection import AmqpConnection
from threading import Thread
import time
import random

messages = []
msg_counts = {}

def send_message_loop():
def on_message():
def main():

if __name__ == '__main__': main()
    </pre>
    <p>First we'll create a short list of random messages.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">messages = ['Hello, World!', 'Foo Bar Baz', 'Crème Anglaise', 'Maddox Lost', 'Epstein didn\'t kill himself']</pre>
    <p>We’ll define our <code class="prettyprint">main</code> function to create an instance of our <code class="prettyprint">AmqpConnection</code> class, connect to the server, fork off a thread to send random messages in a loop, and consume them with our <code class="prettyprint">on_message</code> callback. The AmqpConnection constructor is smartly written to assume default configuration for a RabbitMQ instance running on your machine, so we’ll leave it that way.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
def main():
    mq = AmqpConnection()
    mq.connect()
    mq.setup_queues()
    Thread(target=send_message_loop, args=[mq]).start()
    mq.consume(on_message)      
    </pre>
    <p>The <code class="prettyprint">send_message_loop</code> function will accept <code class="prettyprint">mq</code> as an argument, the instance of our <code class="prettyprint">AmqpConnection</code> class. The function will run in a separate thread, so when it publishes messages it must wrap the <code class="prettyprint">mq.publish</code> method call within an invocation of <code class="prettyprint">mq.do_async</code> to schedule the call on the main connection thread, ensuring thread safety. If you called <code class="prettyprint">mq.publish</code> directly, an exception would be thrown.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
def send_message_loop(mq):
  while True:
      random_message = random.choice(messages)
      mq.do_async(mq.publish, payload=random_message)
      time.sleep(3.0)
    </pre>
    <p>We finally need to define <code class="prettyprint">on_message</code>, our callback function for the <code class="prettyprint">mq.consume</code> method. Pika’s <code class="prettyprint">channel.basic_consume</code> takes a callback whose signature is <code class="prettyprint">on_message_callback(channel, method, properties, body)</code>, so that’s what our function will look like, though we only care about <code class="prettyprint">body</code> in our app, which is the message payload.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
def on_message(channel, method, properties, body):
    msg = body.decode('utf8')
    if msg not in msg_counts:
        msg_counts[msg] = 1
    else:
        msg_counts[msg] = msg_counts[msg] + 1
    print(f'Time: {int(time.time()) % 1000} --- Message: {msg} --- Count: {msg_counts[msg]}')
    </pre>
    <h2>Testing the Application</h2>
    <p>I have a RabbitMQ instance running on ‘192.168.1.111’, so I changed the first line of the <code class="prettyprint">main</code> function to <code class="prettyprint">mq = AmqpConnection(hostname='192.168.1.111')</code>, then I ran <code class="prettyprint">python app.py</code> and saw our app was working as expected. I took down the RabbitMQ server for about a minute, and once it was back up, our application automatically reconnected and resumed operation.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I hope you learned a little something about RabbitMQ and how to use Python's Pika library to easily interact with it. This project isn't hosted on my github because it's not a worthwhile application and it's very small. You can easily copy the code from here and adapt it to a real application. Enjoy.</p>
